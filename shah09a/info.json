    "abstract": "<p>\nIn this paper, we introduce PEBL, a Python library and\napplication for learning Bayesian network structure from data and prior knowledge that\nprovides features unmatched by alternative software packages: the ability to use\ninterventional data, flexible specification of structural priors, modeling with\nhidden variables and exploitation of parallel processing.\n</p>\n<p>\nPEBL is released under the MIT open-source license, can\n be installed from the Python Package Index and is available at\n <a href=\"http://pebl-project.googlecode.com\">http://pebl-project.googlecode.com</a>.\n</p>",
