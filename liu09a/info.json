    "abstract": "Recent methods for estimating sparse undirected graphs for\nreal-valued data in high dimensional problems rely heavily on the assumption of normality.\nWe show how to use a semiparametric Gaussian copula---or\n\"nonparanormal\"---for high dimensional inference.  Just as additive\nmodels extend linear models by replacing linear functions with a set\nof one-dimensional smooth functions, the nonparanormal extends the\nnormal by transforming the variables by smooth functions.  We derive a\nmethod for estimating the nonparanormal, study the method's\ntheoretical properties, and show that it works well in many examples.",
