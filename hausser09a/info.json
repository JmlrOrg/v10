    "abstract": "We present a procedure for effective estimation of entropy and mutual\ninformation from small-sample data, and apply it to the problem of\ninferring high-dimensional gene association networks. Specifically, we\ndevelop a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator, resulting in a procedure\nthat is highly efficient statistically as well as computationally.\nDespite its simplicity, we show that it outperforms eight other entropy\nestimation procedures across a diverse range of sampling scenarios and\ndata-generating models, even in cases of severe undersampling. We\nillustrate the approach by analyzing <i>E. coli</i> gene expression data and\ncomputing an entropy-based gene-association network from gene expression\ndata. A computer program is available that implements the proposed\nshrinkage estimator.",
