    "abstract": "RL-Glue is a standard, language-independent software package for\nreinforcement-learning experiments.  The standardization provided by\nRL-Glue facilitates code sharing and collaboration.  Code sharing\nreduces the need to re-engineer tasks and experimental apparatus, both\ncommon barriers to comparatively evaluating new ideas in the context\nof the literature.  Our software features a minimalist interface and\nworks with several languages and computing platforms. RL-Glue\ncompatibility can be extended to any programming language that\nsupports network socket communication. RL-Glue has been used to teach\nclasses, to run international competitions, and is currently used by\nseveral other open-source software and hardware projects.",
