    "abstract": "There are many excellent toolkits which provide support for developing\nmachine learning software in Python, R, Matlab, and similar\nenvironments.  Dlib-ml is an open source library, targeted at both\nengineers and research scientists, which aims to provide a similarly\nrich environment for developing machine learning software in the C++\nlanguage.  Towards this end, dlib-ml contains an extensible linear\nalgebra toolkit with built in BLAS support.  It also houses\nimplementations of algorithms for performing inference in Bayesian\nnetworks and kernel-based methods for classification, regression,\nclustering, anomaly detection, and feature ranking.  To enable easy\nuse of these tools, the entire library has been developed with\ncontract programming, which provides complete and precise\ndocumentation as well as powerful debugging tools.",
