    "abstract": "This paper reviews and extends the field of similarity-based classification,\npresenting new analyses, algorithms, data sets, and a comprehensive set of\nexperimental results for a rich collection of classification problems.\nSpecifically, the generalizability of using similarities as features is\nanalyzed, design goals and methods for weighting nearest-neighbors for\nsimilarity-based learning are proposed, and different methods for consistently\nconverting similarities into kernels are compared. Experiments on eight real\ndata sets compare eight approaches and their variants to similarity-based\nlearning.",
