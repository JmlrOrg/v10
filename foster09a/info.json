    "abstract": "The use of Gaussian processes can be an effective approach to\nprediction in a supervised learning environment.  For large data\nsets, the standard Gaussian process approach requires solving very\nlarge systems of linear equations and approximations are required\nfor the calculations to be practical.   We will focus on the\nsubset of regressors approximation technique. We will demonstrate\nthat there can be numerical instabilities in a well known\nimplementation of the technique. We discuss alternate\nimplementations that have better numerical stability properties\nand can lead to better predictions. Our results will be\nillustrated by looking at an application involving prediction of\ngalaxy redshift from broadband spectrum data.",
