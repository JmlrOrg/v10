    "abstract": "This paper presents Model Monitor (<i>M</i><sup>2</sup>), a Java toolkit for robustly\nevaluating machine learning algorithms in the presence of changing\ndata distributions.  <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> provides a simple and intuitive framework\nin which users can evaluate classifiers under hypothesized shifts in\ndistribution and therefore determine the best model (or models) for\ntheir data under a number of potential scenarios.  Additionally, <i>M</i><sup>2</sup>\nis fully integrated with the WEKA machine learning environment, so\nthat a variety of commodity classifiers can be used if desired.",
