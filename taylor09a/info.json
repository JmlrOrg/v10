    "abstract": "The reinforcement learning paradigm is a popular way to address\nproblems that have only limited environmental feedback, rather than\ncorrectly labeled examples, as is common in other machine learning\ncontexts. While significant progress has been made to improve learning\nin a single task, the idea of <i>transfer learning</i> has only\nrecently been applied to reinforcement learning tasks. The core idea\nof transfer is that experience gained in learning to perform one task\ncan help improve learning performance in a related, but different,\ntask. In this article we present a framework that classifies transfer\nlearning methods in terms of their capabilities and goals, and then\nuse it to survey the existing literature, as well as to suggest future\ndirections for transfer learning work.",
