    "abstract": "Process discovery is the automated construction of structured\nprocess models from information system event logs. Such event logs\noften contain positive examples only. Without negative examples,\nit is a challenge to strike the right balance between recall and\nspecificity, and to deal with problems such as expressiveness,\nnoise, incomplete event logs, or the inclusion of prior knowledge.\nIn this paper, we present a configurable technique that deals with\nthese challenges by representing process discovery as a\nmulti-relational classification problem on event logs supplemented\nwith Artificially Generated Negative Events (AGNEs). This problem\nformulation allows using learning algorithms and evaluation\ntechniques that are well-know in the machine learning community.\nMoreover, it allows users to have a declarative control over the\ninductive bias and language bias.",
