    "abstract": "Consider the following problem: given sets of unlabeled observations,\neach set with known label proportions, predict the labels of another\nset of observations, possibly with known label proportions. This\nproblem occurs in areas like e-commerce, politics, spam filtering and\nimproper content detection. We present consistent estimators which can\nreconstruct the correct labels with high probability in a uniform\nconvergence sense. Experiments show that our method works well in\npractice.",
